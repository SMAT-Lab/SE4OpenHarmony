/**
 * An object pool for recycling of object instances extending Poolable.
 *
 *
 * Cost/Benefit :
 *   Cost - The pool can only contain objects extending Poolable.
 *   Benefit - The pool can very quickly determine if an object is elligable for storage without iteration.
 *   Benefit - The pool can also know if an instance of Poolable is already stored in a different pool instance.
 *   Benefit - The pool can grow as needed, if it is empty
 *   Cost - However, refilling the pool when it is empty might incur a time cost with sufficiently large capacity.  Set the replenishPercentage to a lower number if this is a concern.
