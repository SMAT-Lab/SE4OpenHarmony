# Security Guidelines

Please contact us directly at **security@3rd-Eden.com** for any bug that might
impact the security of this project. Please prefix the subject of your email
with `[security]` in lowercase and square brackets. Our email filters will
automatically prevent these messages from being moved to our spam box. All
emails that do not include security vulnerabilities will be removed and blocked
instantly.

In addition to a dedicated email address to receive security related reports,
we also have a [Hacker1 account][hacker1] that can be used for communicating
security related issues.

You will receive an acknowledgement of your report within **24 hours** of
notification.

## Exceptions

If you do not receive an acknowledgement within the said time frame please give
us the benefit of the doubt as it's possible that we haven't seen it yet. In
this case please send us a message **without details** using one of the
following methods:

- Give a poke on Twitter [@3rdEden](https://twitter.com/3rdEden)
- Contact the lead developers of this project on their personal e-mails. You
  can find the e-mails in the git logs, for example using the following command:
  `git --no-pager show -s --format='%an <%ae>' <gitsha>` where `<gitsha>` is the
  SHA1 of their latest commit in the project.

Once we have acknowledged receipt of your report and confirmed the bug
ourselves we will work with you to fix the vulnerability and publicly
acknowledge your responsible disclosure, if you wish.
